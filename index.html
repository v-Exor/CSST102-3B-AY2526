      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Basic Machine Learning introduces students to the fundamental concepts, principles, and techniques of machine learning. The course explores how computers can learn from data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions with minimal human intervention. Students will gain hands-on experience with basic algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, laying the groundwork for more advanced studies in artificial intelligence and data science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subject emphasizes both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of machine learning across various fields such as business, science, and technology.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>1. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p>Covers the two main types of learning: supervised learning (training with labeled data) and unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>2. Model Training and Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Focuses on building machine learning models, training them on datasets, and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p>Highlights the importance of cleaning, transforming, and selecting relevant data to improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models.</p>
